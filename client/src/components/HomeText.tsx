        We hope that our service can contribute to the fight against this global pandemic 
        by helping policy makers and clinicians make better-informed decisions and by 
        helping researchers generate new insights.

        To properly calibrate expectations, our system relies on inference using 
        computationally-expensive neural models at search time, and thus the 
        interface is not as responsive as we'd like. We're working hard on making the 
        system more robust and faster, so please be patient! In terms of answer quality, 
        the results are better than keyword search overall (at least in our opinion), 
        but as is often the case with neural networks, sometimes the output can leave 
        users scratching their heads. We're also working hard on improving the answers!

          means that in addition to using our search application on the web above, 
          individual components such as the searcher, neural reranker, and passage

          build on these components!
