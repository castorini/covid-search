        &nbsp;provided by the <Link href="https://allenai.org/">Allen Institute for AI</Link> (data
        release of April 10, 2020), which currently contains over 47,000 scholarly articles,
        including over 36,000 with full text, about COVID-19 and coronavirus-related research, drawn
        from a variety of sources including PubMed, a curated list of articles from the WHO, as well
        as preprints from bioRxiv and medRxiv. We hope that our service can contribute to the fight
        against this global pandemic by helping policy makers and clinicians make better-informed
        decisions and by helping researchers generate new insights.

        To properly calibrate expectations, our system relies on inference using
        computationally-expensive neural models at search time, and thus the interface is not as
        responsive as we'd like. We're working hard on making the system more robust and faster, so
        please be patient! In terms of answer quality, the results are better than keyword search
        overall (at least in our opinion), but as is often the case with neural networks, sometimes
        the output can leave users scratching their heads. We're also working hard on improving the
        answers!
