      <p><b>Covidex</b> represents an effort to build natural language processing and information retrieval components for exploring the <a href="https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research">COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)</a> provided by the <a href="https://allenai.org/">Allen Institute for AI</a>.
         We hope that these tools can help researchers generate new insights in support of the fight against the disease.
      </p>

      <p>The <b>Neural Covidex</b> applies state-of-the-art neural network models to improve the output of our <a href="http://covidex.io/">basic search interface</a> that relies on keyword matching.
         The entire software stack is available open-source on <a href="https://github.com/castorini/covidex">Github</a>, which means that in addition to using this search application on the web, individual components such as the searcher, neural reranker, and passage highlighter can be reused elsewhere as well.
         We'd love other researchers to build on these components!
      </p>

      <p>To properly calibrate expectations, our system relies on inference using computational-expensive neural models at search time, and thus the interface is not as responsive as we'd like.
         We're working hard on making the system more robust and faster, so please be patient!
         In terms of search quality, results are much better than keyword-only search overall (at least in our opinion), but as is often the case with neural networks, sometimes the output can leave users scratching their heads.

      <p>This project is led by <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/">Jimmy Lin</a> from the University of Waterloo and <a href="http://www.kyunghyuncho.me/">Kyunghyun Cho</a> from NYU, with a small team of wonderful students: <a href="https://github.com/edwinzhng">Edwin Zhang</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nikhilro">Nikhil Gupta</a>.
